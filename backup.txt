Although precise dating of its construction and subsequent enhancements are uncertain, historians and archaeologists generally accept that an earlier brick-walled structure was replaced with stone by Ganapatideva, who died in 1262, and that his successors – Rudramadevi and Prataparudra II – added to its height and added gateways, square bastions and additional circular earthern walls prior to the latter's death in 1323.</p>
